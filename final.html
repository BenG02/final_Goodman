					<h3>Max & Justin, an Introduction</h3>
					<p>As a sports fan there is always a large amount of time spent arguing over how good a player is, and more often than not this becomes a debate of the best in the sport. While every baseball lover enjoys watching home runs get walloped into the stands by elite batters, there is clearly a lack of credit given to those pitchers on the mound keeping their team in the game. Pitchers can truly dominate the game on their own, and there is arguably no other position in any sport where one can individually set the game's level of intensity and control the final score of the game.</p>
					<p>In over 150 years of baseball being America's national pastime, the sport has seen thousands of pitchers throw to the best hitters the world has to offer. Some pitchers were successful enough to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame, and some retired early due to lack of ability, but it is difficult to rank even the top 50 pitchers of all time. Enter right handers Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander.</p>
					<p class="last-paragraph">Since 2010, these two men have cemented themselves in baseball history, tearing up hitters and producing electric results from the defensive side. Two of the best pitchers in Major League Baseball today, the pair of late 30-year-olds are highly regarded as future hall-of-famers. There can only be one "best" pitcher, so I used statistics like earned run average (ERA), innings pitched (IP) and win-loss ratio to prove which of these veterans is statistically better at their best. </p>

					<h3>Best of the Best: The Nitty Gritty Statistics</h3>
					<p>Perhaps one of the most important statistics in baseball is ERA, which is the running average of runs allowed per 9 innings pitched. Over Verlander's career, he has shown signs of immortality, posting an average ERA of 3.13. Scherzer has been right in his kitchen, however, posting only .01 higher than Verlander with a career ERA of 3.14.</p>
					<p>Justin Verlander has started only two more games than Max Scherzer, even after an injury ended Verlander's 2015 season. However, he still pitched significantly more, throwing 80 innings more than Scherzer. This is the equivalent to about 9 full games, showing Verlander pitched into games deeper than Scherzer. </p>
					<p>Although Verlander has seen the later innings more than Scherzer, Max still has a great track record of winning games for his team. He holds a remarkable 190-97 record to make his win/loss ratio .663, winning nearly 100 more games than he lost. Verlander has pitched more games, but still lost 42 more games than Scherzer and holds a 226-139 record, making his win loss ratio .637.</p>
					<p class="last-paragraph">Even though Verlander has pitched more games and innings than Scherzer, maybe Max's biggest advantage is his ability to pitch for the strikeout. Their strikeout numbers are significantly different as Max punched out 2,452, 192 more than Verlander's 2,250.</p>

					<h3>So Who Truly Reigns Supreme?</h3>
					<p>One of the best things about baseball is no matter what position you play, you can always be better than someone in the same position in multiple aspects. MLB Advanced Media Analyst and Syracuse University Alumni Steven Geisenheimer praised both pitchers as high-end competitors. "All decade long it seemed that Justin Verlander was the pitcher of our generation," Geisenheimer says. "Towards the end, Scherzer showed he could keep improving with age and pounded the strike zone with numbers never seen, both players are just such generational talents.</p>
					<p class="last-paragraph">Both players won a world series, Verlander with the Houston Astros in 2017 and Max Scherzer with the Washington Nationals in 2019. Scherzer has racked up three Cy Young awards (pitcher of the year) and Verlander has taken home two. In 2011, Verlander won the MVP in the American League. According to NBCSports, "Scherzer has a better regular season and postseason win percentage since he became a National, and more strikeouts per nine innings in the regular season and postseason." So while Verlander has pitched more innings with a slightly lower ERA, Scherzer has more wins and racks up more strikeouts. Each player has achieved elite status and are both better and worse than each other in their own ways, which makes it so hard to truly determine who the single best pitcher is.</p>

			<h3>In Conclusion..</h3>
			<p>As the sport of baseball continues to evolve, hitters will naturally undergo training to reach their maximum potential which makes the performance of these two pitchers even more impressive. With a new group of young, generational talents entering the league each year, the near-40-year-old pitchers prove that skill stays consistent amongst the best. These two pitchers continue to mow down batters at an other-worldly pace with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
			<p class=last-paragraph>The debate between Scherzer and Verlander will continue to be heated, as a case could be made that any of the two are better. If Scherzer wasn't injured in 2011 and Verlander in 2015, this may have been a slightly different debate, however both men have already carved their names into the history books and will continue to pitch in the majors for a few more years to come.</p>
